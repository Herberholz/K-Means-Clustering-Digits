# K-Means-Clustering-Digits

Dataset: Each instance has 64 attributes, each of which can have value 0âˆ’16. Each instance also has a label specifying which of 10 digit classes it belongs to.  

Code to write:  Write a program to implement K-means clustering using Euclidean distance, and to evaluate the resulting clustering using average mean-square-error, mean-square-separation, and accuracy.
